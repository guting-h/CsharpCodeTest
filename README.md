# Getting Started

Make sure that you have a recent version of Visual Studio install, e.g. from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

- Start by cloning the repository to your local computer by clicking on the green button "<> Code" and select "Open with Visual Studio."
- After the Visual Studio window pops, choose a valid Path (or use the default one) and click "Clone."
- When the application correctly opens on Visual Studio, start it by clicking the second green button on the top labeled as "Start Without Debugging."
- The application then starts from the console.
